# Dotfiles

## Setup
You'll need to follow the setup instructions for the JazzCore/ctrlp-cmatcher. It requires some manually installation.

## Dependencies
My dotfiles have a few dependencies. Most of these can be installed with
[homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

To install these dependencies cd into the Dotfiles directory and type `brew
bundle`.
