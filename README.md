## Dependencies
I use neovim so I can't promise this setup will work with regular vim.

Some packages require neovim's python extensions. To be safe, it's best to have
python2 and python3 installed and available on your path. To check this you
enter the comand `:CheckHealth`.

You'll also need the silver searcher.

You'll need the tmuxinator for the zshrc config
