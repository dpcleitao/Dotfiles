# Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. Like all dotfiles, they are largely stolen from other,
smarter people. Let me know if you find them useful or if you have any
suggestions for how they could be improved!

## Setup
You'll need to follow the setup instructions for the vim plugin
[ctrlp-cmatcher](https://github.com/JazzCore/ctrlp-cmatcher). It requires some
manual installation.

## Dependencies
My dotfiles have a few dependencies. Most of these can be installed with
[homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

To install these dependencies with homebrew cd into the Dotfiles directory and
type `brew bundle`. You can comment out any dependencies you don't want in the
Brewfile.
